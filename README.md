# Brewfile of August Guidry

I created this file to streamline the installation of my favorite brew packages across the Macintosh computers I work with. To my surprise, I discovered that others were also developing similar files. Initially, I named it "brewscript," but I later learned that the correct term for such a file is "brewfile."
